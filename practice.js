  Create an empty Object called backPack.
  Now, create a variable called 'item' and set it equal to the string 'firstPocket'.
  Using bracket notation, add a 'firstPocket' key (or property) to backPack, using 'item'.

  Using dot notation, add another key (or property) to your backPack object that is named color, with the value being the color of your backpack.

You probably noticed that it just alerted [object Object].
Alerting to see the data in your Object doesn't work so well.
Instead, console.log your whole backPack object and then check out the console.
